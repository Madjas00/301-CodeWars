For this challenge we are given an array of three numbers. We then need to return the index of the number that would lie between the other two numbers. To start this off we made a copy of the array using the .slice(0). We then went on to sort the array numerically using the .sort(). This didn't quite sort the array correctly so we also had to use a function. Finally we returned the index of the number that would be the middle number in the second array inputArray.indexOf(newArr[1]). This solved the challenge.

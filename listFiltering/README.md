For this challenge we needed to take in an array. We then needed to remove the strings and leave the integers. The first step was to create a copy of the array. I did this by using the .slice method. We then needed to use the .filter method to search for the strings and remove them. Then I used the parseInt to turn the strings into numbers and check to see if they equal what we wanted exactly. They didn't make a match so it left them out and returned the array with only the numbers left over.

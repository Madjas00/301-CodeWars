For this challenge the problem was that we are taking in a string of all lower case letters. We then need to return an array that has a string of every odd position uppercase and another string of every even position uppercase. So first we put the string and made it into an array. We made two separate variables, wordEven and wordOdd. We looped through both of them and used the i % 2 === 0 for the even. And the i % 2 !== 0 for the odds. This helped to pick out both the odd and even positions. We then used the toUpperCase to capitalize the letters in those positions. We returned the wordEven and wordOdd into the array and that solved the problem.

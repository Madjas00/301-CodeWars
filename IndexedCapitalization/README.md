For this challenge we needed to take in a string and an array. We then needed to capitalize the letters in the string that are in the position of places in the array. For example if we get a string of a,b,c and an array of[0,2] the result of the string would be A,b,C. To start this off we turned the string into an array using the .split(''). Next we loop through the array. Then we say if arr includes the position at (i) letterArr[i] gets capitalized. We then turn the array back into a string and return it. This was able to solve the challenge.

For this challenge the problem that we had to solve was that a function would take in numbers. We then had to take the numbers and insert dashes between wherever there was odd numbers next to each other. The function then needs to return a string of numbers that has dashes between the 2 odd numbers. So for the first step we needed to convert the numbers into a string. We also decided to create an array of all the possible odd numbers to compare them with each of the numbers in the string. Then we also created a variable that creates an empty sring that we can put our numbers into to return at the end of the function. We then created a loop that would go through each number and compare the numbers to the numbers in the odd number array. We told the loop that if the number was also in the odd array and the number next to that one is also in the odd array to add a dash between them and put it into the string. If it doesn't see an odd number next to each other it puts it into the string and does not add a dash. We then return the string and that does it for the function.

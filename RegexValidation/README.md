The problem for this kata was that we needed to validate a username. The username can include a lowercase letter a number and a underscore. The username also has to be 4-16 characters in lenght. To validate the username we have to use regex. So we start by letting it know what can be included. We tell it that it can have a-z 0-9 and _. We then tell it that it has to be between 4-16 characters long by using {4,16}. We then use a .test so that we can test the username for a true or false. We then return the results and that solves the problem.

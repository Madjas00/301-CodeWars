The problem for this challenge was to first take a string into a function. We then take that string and remove all of the vowels within it. For example "Hello World" would become "Hll Wrld". To do this we use the replace method. Next we use regular expressions to tell it to look for all the uses of [AEIOU]. We use g in regular expressions to find all the uses of vowels as we can. We also use i in regular expressions to make it case insensitive. We tell it to replace the vowel with a '' which just removes it from the string. This was able to solve the challenge.
